Fakecraft by Joshua Petherick

This project was created for my semester one, year two, coursework for Game Development at the University of Brighton.

To help create this project I followed a helpful tutorial on OpenGL:  http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/

The site above is under the "DO WHAT THE F*** YOU WANT" license. 

I also used a texture from this free image site:  http://freestocktextures.com/texture/id/703

The is a small project, similarly to Minecraft, where the entire world is constructed of cubes. It is a small world, containing only a large plane of grass with a small house sitting on top. There is no aim to this project, no objective to follow, it is just a peaceful little world. 

I created, worked in and compiled using Ubuntu so the steps I will provide you are designed to work within most Linux systems. You will need most OpenGL librarys, however the project does contain a few libraries to help with compiling. 

You can run this project by following these steps:

-   cd Fakecraft   (cd until you're into the Fakecraft directory)

-   mkdir build    (Make a new folder called build)

-   cd build       (Head into the build folder)

-   cmake ..       (There is a cmake file in the folder above, type this to run it)

-   make all       (This compiles everything, do this once you've altered the project)

-   cd ..          (Head back up into the Fakecraft Directory)

-   cd src         (Head into the source directory)

-   ./src          (Run the executable, named src for convenience)

Have fun!
